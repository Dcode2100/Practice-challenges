/* difference in let,var and const.

 var is not used right now because it can be changed 
 var was used maximum times before ES6, today var is defined in ES6 as global variable
 
 let are block level scope variable it can be updated inside its scope
 let cannot be redeclared, 
 i.e in brackets.

 const variable cannot be redeclared and reupdated
 const has to be initilised unlike let and var.
